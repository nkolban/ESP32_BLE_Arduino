# ESP32 BLE for Arduino

This repository is deprecated. The BLE code is now part of the ESP32 Arduino core, making it automatically available to any Arduino ESP32 project without the need for manual import. For more information, see [ESP32 Arduino BLE Library](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/BLE).
----------------

The Arduino IDE provides an excellent library package manager where versions of libraries can be downloaded and installed.  This Github project provides the repository for the ESP32 BLE support for Arduino.
